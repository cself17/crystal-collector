# crystal-collector
1) What the project does?
The project is a game that you can play.  There are four crystals.  Each crystal has a random number that you can't see associated to it.  When you click on a crystal you gain the amount of points that one crystal has.  

There is a random total amount of points that you are trying to attain exactly.  You have to click on the right crystals the right amount of times to get the number the exact total random amount of points.

When you exceed the random amount of points, you lose the game.
When you get exactly the random amount of point, you win the game.
When you win a game, the win counter goes up.
When you lose a game, the lose counter goes up.

After you win or lose a game, the game resets the random numbers for the crystals and the exact random number you need to get.
